## SQL_Practice
This effort of mine is a compilation of the SQL query and Database Design questions which I came across through many interviews and also some are frequently asked questions from various sources. The queries are in format supported by <b>Oracle-Database</b>. And for database design, I have used <b>Dia</b> which is a free and open source general-purpose diagramming software. 

Link to download <b>Dia</b> : https://sourceforge.net/projects/dia-installer/files/dia-win32-installer/0.97.2/dia-setup-0.97.2-2-unsigned.exe/download
